2) - Create two lists of numbers (lst1, lst2) interactively and merge them into a new third sorted list(lst3) and output it to the console.

3) - Interactively build a dictionary, write a function to check if the given 'key' exists in the dictionary. 

4) - Interactively build a dictionary and write a function that adds a key value pair to the dictionary, and another that deletes a pair. 

5) - write a function that takes two lists (of same length) as input and created a dictionary from it.

6) - Build a function that asks words to as user input and created a dictionary of first 'char' as key and the word as value. 

7) - Use 'csv' module to read a simple .csv file and create a dictionary. (HINT: use csv's 'DictReader' method)

8) - Read contents of a .txt file, and print the content to the console

9) - Read content of 'data1.txt' and copy to another new file 'data2.txt'. Confirm the copy and
print the number of lines in the console. Same can be done to append to an existing file 'data2.txt'

10) - read file 'data.txt', count the number of words and blank spaces, and output to console.

11) - Print the content of 'data.txt' in reverse order to console. (Last line first and so on...)

13) - Write an interactive console program, that takes user input in lines and appends to 
existing file 'data.txt'

14) - Read a file 'data.txt', find a particular word, say "was" or 'Has" and replace it with "REPLACED" and write back to the file.

15) - Read a file 'data.txt', count and print the following to the console. 
	Number of Lines in the File: xxx
	Number of non-empty Words in the File: xxx
	Number of whitespaces in the File: xxx
